# Challenge 2

In challenge 1, our model achieved an accuracy of `~92%`. For the MNIST data set, this is not very good. For improving model accuracy, we'll be training a [Deep Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) in this challenge. For training this more powerful and complex model, we'll need more compute power. Therefore, instead of training a model on our Compute Instance, we'll be using [Azure Machine Learning Compute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-set-up-training-targets) to train our model on a dedicated compute cluster. As a Machine Learning framework, we'll be using Keras with a TensorFlow backend. The interaction with Azure Machine Learning won't change.

**Note:** Obviously we do not really need a Compute Cluster for such a simple task, a single Compute Instance (VM) (even without GPU) would be absolutely sufficient. However - for sake of education - we'll be using Compute Cluster in this challenge.

First, let's create a new notebook `challenge02.ipynb` for this challenge.

As before we connect to our Azure ML Workspace, but we'll create a new experiment this time:

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Experiment, Run
ws = Workspace.from_config()

experiment = Experiment(workspace = ws, name = "keras-tf-mnist")
```

We should still have our MNIST dataset sitting in the `./data/` folder from challenge 1, but just in case, we'll download it again:

```python
import os
import urllib.request

os.makedirs('./data', exist_ok = True)

urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    'https://github.com/aidevcollege/aidevcollege/raw/master/day1/AzureMachineLearningService/data/train-images.gz', 
    filename='./data/train-images.gz')

urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    'https://github.com/aidevcollege/aidevcollege/raw/master/day1/AzureMachineLearningService/data/train-labels.gz', 
    filename='./data/train-labels.gz')

urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    'https://github.com/aidevcollege/aidevcollege/raw/master/day1/AzureMachineLearningService/data/test-images.gz', 
    filename='./data/test-images.gz')

urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    'https://github.com/aidevcollege/aidevcollege/raw/master/day1/AzureMachineLearningService/data/test-labels.gz', 
    filename='./data/test-labels.gz')
```

In this challenge, we'll be training remotely. Therefore, we'll need to be able to access the MNIST dataset from our compute cluster.

To do so, we'll upload our data to the default datastore that our Azure ML Workspace provided for us. This code will retrieve the default datastore (Azure Blob) and upload the four files from MNIST into the `./mnist` folder:

```python
ds = ws.get_default_datastore()

print("Datastore details:")
print("Type:", ds.datastore_type)
print("Storage Account:", ds.account_name)
print("Blob Container Name:", ds.container_name)

ds.upload(src_dir='./data', target_path='mnist', overwrite=True, show_progress=True)
```

Let's have a look at the files in the respective Storage Account. For this you will go into the `Azure Portal` and select the default `Storage` Account that the Azure ML Workspace created for us. Select `Containers` on the left tile. Then you select `azureml-blobstore-[...]` and the `mnist` folder within. We can see that the dataset has been uploaded:

![alt text](../images/MNISTdatasetinBlob.png "MNIST dataset in Azure Blob")

Next, we can create a `compute cluster` in Azure.
Behind the scenes a [VM-Scale-Set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview) running Docker will be deployed. Later on, our training script will be containerized, executed and logged on those VMs.

```python
from azureml.core.compute import AmlCompute
from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget
import os

# Configure our cluster details
compute_name = "cpucluster"
compute_min_nodes = 0
compute_max_nodes = 4
vm_size = "Standard_F4s_v2"

# Check if a cluster with the same name already exists # Behind the scenes VM-Scale-Set running Docker on it
compute_targets = ws.compute_targets
if compute_name in compute_targets and compute_targets[compute_name].type == 'AmlCompute':
    print("Found compute target, let's just reuse it:", compute_name)
    compute_target = ws.compute_targets[compute_name]

else:
    print('Creating a new compute target, this will take a few minutes...')
    compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size = vm_size,
                                                           min_nodes = compute_min_nodes,
                                                           max_nodes = compute_max_nodes)

    # Create the cluster
    compute_target = ComputeTarget.create(ws, compute_name, compute_config)

    # We can poll for a minimum number of nodes and for a specific timeout.
    compute_target.wait_for_completion(show_output=True, min_node_count=None, timeout_in_minutes=20)

    # For a more detailed view of current AmlCompute status, use the 'status' property
    print(compute_target.status.serialize())
```

The cluster VM(s) will take around 2-4 minutes to spin up :clap:.

We can configure our minimum and maximum cluster size and
the VM size. In our example, we'll stick with a medium VM
without GPU for saving cost. If you want, you can try out a more powerful VM,
or even a `NC` instance with dedicated GPU. More details on further configuration parameters can
be found
[here](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.amlcompute(class)?view=azure-ml-py#provisioning-configuration-vm-size-----vm-priority--dedicated---min-nodes-0--max-nodes-none--idle-seconds-before-scaledown-none--vnet-resourcegroup-name-none--vnet-name-none--subnet-name-none--tags-none--description-none->),
as for example `idle_seconds_before_scaledown`, which defines when the
cluster should auto-scale down (only makes sense if `min_nodes != max_nodes`).

If we now look under the `Compute` tab beneath `Training clusters` or `Compute clusters`in our Azure ML Workspace, we can see our Azure Machine Learning Compute cluster:

![alt text](../images/02-create_training_cluster.png "Creating our Machine Learning Compute cluster for training")

In the last challenge, we had all our code in our Jupyter Notebook. Since we're training remotely now, our Machine Learning Compute cluster needs to somehow get the Python code for reading the data and training our model. Hence, we create a `scripts` folder and put our training Python code in it (useful if we're using multiple `*.py` files):

```python
import os, shutil

script_folder = './scripts'
os.makedirs(script_folder, exist_ok=True)
```

The cell below writes the `train.py` to the `scripts` folder (we could have created it manually and copied it in).
If you want to know more about `Tensorflow` you can read the following [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan).

os.makedirs('outputs', exist_ok=True)
model.save('./outputs/keras-tf-mnist.h5')
```

This looks a little bit more complex than our last example! Let's walk through what this script does:

1. On the first line we use some iPython [cellmagic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cellmagic-writefile) to write the content of the cell to a file
1. We define a custom callback class for logging the results of each epoch into our Azure Machine Learning workspace
1. We define the input parameters for the script (data folder, batch size, and number of training epochs)
1. We load the data from our Azure Blob share
1. We transform the data to the format that [`Keras`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) expects
1. We get hold of the current run (`Run.get_submitted_run()`) - the SDK will manage the run this time
1. We build a Convolution Neural Network with convolutional layers with ReLu as the activation function, followed by a dense 128 neuron large fully connected layer
1. We let `Keras` assemble and train the model
1. We run our test data through it and get the predictions
1. We log the final train and test accuracies to our experiment
1. We save the model to the `outputs/` folder (Azure Machine Learning Compute will automatically upload that folder to the experiment afterwards)

This [visualization](https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*-xPK2X22QAU7ssU8ErD0pw.jpeg) show's a bit more in detail what our model does.

To get the training working, we need to create an environment and package the scripts:

```python
from azureml.core import Environment
from azureml.core.conda_dependencies import CondaDependencies
from azureml.core.runconfig import DockerConfiguration

# Create a Python environment for the experiment
# Let Azure ML manage dependencies by setting user_managed_dependencies to False
# Use docker containers by setting docker.enabled to True
# Our workspace needs to know what environment to use
env = Environment("aidevcollege-env")
env.python.user_managed_dependencies = False  # Let Azure ML manage dependencies

docker_conf = DockerConfiguration(use_docker=True)  # Use a docker container

# Create a the pip and conda package dependencies
packages = CondaDependencies.create(pip_packages=["tensorflow","keras==2.6.0", "astor", 'azureml-sdk',
                                                  'pynacl==1.2.1', 'azureml-dataprep'], pin_sdk_version=False)

# Add the package dependencies to the Python environment for the experiment
env.python.conda_dependencies = packages

# Register the environment
env.register(workspace=ws)
registered_env = Environment.get(ws, 'aidevcollege-env')

```

Then we "send" them to Azure Machine Learning Compute. Azure ML uses the `ScriptRunConfig` class for that:
Which is a configuration for the `Runs` of the `Experiments`.

```python
from azureml.core import ScriptRunConfig

ds = ws.get_default_datastore()

script_params = [ '--data-folder', str(ds.as_mount()), '--batch-size', 128, '--epochs', 8]


# Training Script and Parameters are used in the estimator to run an experiment
estimator = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory=script_folder,
                arguments=script_params,
                compute_target = compute_target,
                environment=registered_env,
                script='train.py',
                docker_runtime_config=docker_conf)

estimator.run_config.data_references = {ds.as_mount().data_reference_name: ds.as_mount().to_config()}
```

As you can see, we define where our scripts are, what the compute target should be, and the dependencies (`keras` in this case). Lastly, we also give some static parameters in the script, but ideally we would [automatically try out different hyperparameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-tune-hyperparameters) to get superior accuracy (not covered here).

**Note**: There is also a separate `TensorFlow` Estimator for just TensorFlow, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-train-tensorflow). Since we want to keep it generic in this challenge, we'll rely on the standard `Estimator`.

Lastly, we can kick off the job:

```python
run = experiment.submit(config=estimator)
run
```

The `Link to Azure Machine Learning studio` will bring us directly into our workspace:

![alt text](../images/02-run_link.png "Our training run is starting")

Under the `Compute` tab, we can also see that our cluster is now training the model:

![alt text](../images/02-running_training.png "Our training is running")

While the training is running, we can also display a nice widget directly in our notebook:

```python
from azureml.widgets import RunDetails
RunDetails(run).show()
```

![alt text](../images/02-training_widget.png "Training widget")

In the background, Azure ML Services will now perform the following steps:

- Package our scripts and dependencies as a Docker image and push it to our Azure Container Registry (initially this will take ~5 minutes) - the Azure Container Registry will be created automatically
- (Scale up the Azure Machine Learning Compute cluster - since we have `min_size=0` and `max_size=4`)
- Pull the Docker image to the Azure Machine Learning Compute cluster
- Mount the MNIST data from Azure Blob to the Azure Machine Learning Compute cluster
- Start the training job
- Publish the results to our Workspace (same as in the last challenge)

We can see the status of the training run by checking our experiment:

![alt text](../images/02-training_progress.png "Making training progress")

The first run takes around ~25-30 minutes. Subsequent runs will be significantly faster (~5 minutes) as the base Docker image will be re-used. By using a more powerful VM, a single run can be executed in less than a minute (in case you use a GPU-equipped instance, but then you might need to tell your framework to use it).

With the same code as before (this is the strength of Azure ML), we can retrieve the results of our training run:

```python
print("Run metrics:", run.get_metrics())
print("Run model files", run.get_file_names())
```

This time we logged our training details as charts:

![alt text](../images/02-final_run.png "Final run results")

This already looks much better, we're now able to predict our test data with over `99%` accuracy!

Lastly, we can register our new model (this is the same code as before):

```python
model = run.register_model(model_name='keras-tf-mnist-model', model_path='outputs/keras-tf-mnist.h5')
print(model.name, model.id, model.version, sep = '\t')
```

At this point (in addition to the results from challenge 1):

- We used the Azure Machine Learning SDK with Azure Machine Learning Compute in the background to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- We switched our training framework from scikit-learn to Keras with TensorFlow in the backend (without changing any Azure ML SDK code!)
- We registered our new model (>`99%` accuracy) in our Azure ML Workspace

Great, now we have a well performing model. Obviously, we want to enable other people, maybe developers, to use it. Therefore, we'll deploy it as an API to an Azure Container Instance in the [next challenge](challenge_03.md).

## Optional: Retrieving the Data from Web Paths as a second Option for this challenge

If you do not want to upload the data to a blob storage - you can retrieve them directly from the respective URLS:
For this you need to adjust the training script, the estimator and import the data via a web path.
You need to change the respective code in the steps above.
Here you can see that the data is retrieved directly from the data folder which will be later set per command line as a web paths:

```python

# ...... SAME CODE FROM ABOVE ...........
data_folder = args.data_folder
print('Data folder:', data_folder)

# get the file paths on the compute
x_train_path = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_folder, '**/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz'), recursive=True)[0]
x_test_path = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_folder, '**/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz'), recursive=True)[0]
y_train_path = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_folder, '**/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz'), recursive=True)[0]
y_test = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_folder, '**/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz'), recursive=True)[0]

# load train and test set into numpy arrays
x_train = load_data(x_train_path, False) / 255.0
x_test = load_data(x_test_path, False) / 255.0
y_train = load_data(y_train_path, True).reshape(-1)
y_test = load_data(y_test, True).reshape(-1)

# ...... SAME CODE FROM ABOVE ...........

```

Here we introduce the Dataset Class - and retrieve directly the dataset from the respective MNIST URLs:

```python
from azureml.train.estimator import Estimator
from azureml.core import ScriptRunConfig
from azureml.core.dataset import Dataset

web_paths = [
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz',
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz',
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz',
            'http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz'
            ]

ds = Dataset.File.from_files(path = web_paths)

script_params = [ '--data-folder', ds.as_mount(), '--batch-size', 128, '--epochs', 8]


# Training Script and Parameters are used in the estimator to run an experiment
estimator2 = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory=script_folder,
                arguments=script_params,
                compute_target = compute_target,
                environment=registered_env,
                script='train2.py',
                docker_runtime_config=docker_conf)
```

In [challenge 3](challenge_03.md), we'll deploy the model as an API.
