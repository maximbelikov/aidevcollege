# AI Developer College Day2 - Cognitive Services

As we have looked at Cognitive Search so far and saw how we can enrich our search service with the Azure Cognitive Services, we will now go into detail of some of those services. Yesterday we trained and registered a model and deployed it as an endpoint. Microsoft offers these services for developers to be able to make your applications smarter by enriching them with intelligence.

## Focus of Today:

## Here is what you will learn

Today will be an overview of Azure Cognitive Services, as you will learn:

- How to deploy Cognitive Services from the areas _Language_, _Speech_, _Vision_ and _Decision_
- How to use those Cognitive Services using Python
- How to train and use custom models (e.g. Custom Vision) yourself

We will cover the following topics in several sections:

| Pillar                | API Service (section)                                                                                                                                                                                          | Documentation                                                                                     |

# Azure Cognitive Services

## What are Azure Cognitive Services?

Azure Cognitive Services:

- are APIs, SDKs and services available to help developers build intelligent applications without having direct Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning expert skills.
- enable developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications.
- help developers create applications that can see, hear, speak, understand and even begin to reason.
- can be categorized into five main pillars - _Language_, _Speech_, _Vision_ and _Decision_.

You can solve the tasks in a programming language of your choice. For sake of convenience, we are providing hints in `Python`, which you can easily run on the `Compute Instance (VM) from the Azure Machine Learning Service` or in `Visual Studio Code`. SDK Support for `C#`, `Node.js` or `.NET Core` is available for most challenges. You can find code examples in the Azure documentation for the associated services.

For this entire challenge we will create a `Resource Group` called `CognitiveServices` as previously shown and described in the **Azure Portal**. All Cognitive Services can be `added` and deployed in this Resource Group.

In the upcoming tasks, we will reuse the `Compute Instance (VM)` from the **Azure Machine Learning Service** and create a new Notebook. We can click the `New` button and create a new Notebook of type: `Python 3.6 - AzureML`. A new browser tab should open up and we can click the name `Untitled` and rename it to `CognitiveServices.ipynb`.

Let's look at the first pillar of Cognitive Services - Language.

# Language

The world is getting more and more connected and therefore, translation services are gaining more significance. The **Azure Translator Cognitive Service** is a cloud-based machine translation service. It is easy to integrate into your applications, websites, tools, and solutions. It allows you to add multi-language user experiences in various [languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Translator/language-support) and can be used on any hardware platform with any operating system for text translation.

## Translator

:triangular_flag_on_post: **Goal:** Translation of multiple sentences, detection of one or more input languages to one or several output languages concurrently.

Let's get started with using the translator service!

First, create a `Translator` API Key in the Azure Portal:

![Translator Text API](./images/New_CreateTranslator.PNG)

![Translator Text API Details](./images/TTCreateDetails.png)

The Translator API allows to directly access the service by specifying the API key. As with other services, you can find the key under "Keys and Endpoint".

Use the `CognitiveServices.ipynb` Notebook which you just created and copy the following code in a cell. We will conduct a REST Call by sending data to the _Translate Cognitive Service_ and receiving a response from the pre-trained Machine Learning model behind the scenes. In this case, we are translating text from English to German.
Replace `YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` and `YOUR_RESOURCE_LOCATION` with the information from your Azure Translator Service as described above and run the cell.

```python
import requests, uuid, json

subscription_key = "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"
location = "YOUR_RESOURCE_LOCATION"
endpoint = "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com"
path = '/translate'
url = endpoint + path

headers = {
  'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key,
  'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region': location,
  'Content-type': 'application/json',
  'X-ClientTraceId': str(uuid.uuid4())
}

params = {
  'api-version': '3.0',
  'from': 'en',
  'to': ['de', 'it']
}

body = [
  {'text' : 'I want to order 4 pizza Magarita and 8 beer!'},
  {'text' : 'Please add 42 salads to the order!'}
]

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, params=params, json=body)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

Example Result:

```json
[
  {
    "translations": [
      {
        "text": "Ich m\u00f6chte 4 Pizza Magarita und 8 Bier bestellen!",
        "to": "de"
      },
      {
        "text": "Voglio ordinare 4 pizza Magarita e 8 birre!",
        "to": "it"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "translations": [
      {
        "text": "Bitte f\u00fcgen Sie der Bestellung 42 Salate hinzu!",
        "to": "de"
      },
      {
        "text": "Si prega di aggiungere 42 insalate all'ordine!",
        "to": "it"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

As we can see, we can translate multiple sentences to multiple languages within one API call. The service also automatically detects the input language. (_Optional_: Try deleting the 'from': 'en' from the params section of the code and see how the json response changes.) It is possible to add optional parameters such as a profanity filter and more.

The Translator Service does not only translate text, but also has the capability of transliterating text from one type of script to another (and much more). You can try it out with the code below:

```python
path = '/transliterate'
url = endpoint + path

params = {
    'api-version': '3.0',
    'language': 'ja',
    'fromScript': 'jpan',
    'toScript': 'latn'
}

body = [
  {'text' : 'こんにちは'}
]

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, params=params, json=body)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

This should be the result:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Kon'nichiwa",
    "script": "latn"
  }
]
```

### Optional: Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration. Since the Azure Cloud Platform consists out of many APIs this tool is perfect to get a deeper understanding of its functionalities. 

[Here](./postman/) you will find 2 Postman collections we have created for you for the Translator API and Text Analytics API. 

[Download Postman](https://app.getpostman.com/app/download/win64) and _Import_ the Translation file. After the import is done it should look like this. 
![Postman after import](./images/02_postman_import.png)

Now go to _Environments_ and create an environment for the Translator API.

- Create a  variable called "api_key", select "secret" as a type, and paste your API key from the portal.

![Postman environments](./images/02_postman_create_environments.png)

Finally, assign the environment created to the Translator collection. 

![Postman environment assign](./images/02_environmen_select_translator.png).

Now, you can play around with the APIs! You can select the different services from the collections tab and click on "Send" to send a request. At the bottom, you should receive a response. You can also change the Parameters to check out different languages, or you can change the body to try out other texts.

## Language Service

| Azure Cognitive Services                                                                                              | Information                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Cognitive Service for Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/overview) | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/overview |

:triangular_flag_on_post: **Goal:** Leverage the Cognitive Service for Language for extracting language, sentiment, key phrases, and entities from text

Now let's continue with some of the remaining **Cognitive Services for Language**. They are deployed using one service called _Language Service_. It provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features for understanding and analyzing text.

First we deploy the **Language** service in the **Azure Portal**:

![Azure Portal](./images/CreateLanguageService.png)

By default, the service comes with several pre-built capabilities like sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction or question answering. It is possible to add customizable features. However, for this exercise we will stick with the pre-built capabilities:

![Azure Portal](./images/CreateLanguageService2.png)

Fill in the _name_, agree to the _Legal Terms_ and _terms of Responsible AI_ and hit _create_:

![Azure Portal](./images/CreateLanguageService3.png)

This time we will use the Python SDK to use this service. Let's start with installing the _text analytics_ package. Copy the following snippet into a new cell in your `CognitiveServices.ipynb` notebook. You might need to restart the kernel.

```
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics
```

Get the key and the region under the section _Keys and Endpoint_ from the Azure portal:

![Azure Portal: Key and URL](./images/keyendpoint.png)

In a next step, we need to create a client object ([TextAnalyticsClient](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-ai-textanalytics/latest/azure.ai.textanalytics.html#azure.ai.textanalytics.TextAnalyticsClient)). Copy the code with the **filled in key and region** into a new cell in your notebook. We will reuse the client object for all following tasks concerning the language service.

```python
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient

key = "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"
region = "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_REGION"

credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
endpoint = f"https://{region}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/"

text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credential)
```

Azure Cognitive Service for Language provides several features. In the following, we will try out only a few of the available features:

- Language Detection ([documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/language-detection/overview))
- Sentiment Analysis ([documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/sentiment-opinion-mining/overview))
- Key Phrase Extraction ([documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/key-phrase-extraction/overview))
- Entity Linking ([documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/entity-linking/overview))

In general, we will conduct [REST](https://restfulapi.net/) calls using the Python SDK to the Cognitive Service by sending some data to the service and letting the **pre-trained Machine Learning Model** behind the scenes give responses regarding the data.

For each of the following features, copy the code blocks into new cells of your Jupyter Notebook.

### Language Detection

Firstly, we can extract the language from text. Run this in a new cell in your `CognitiveServices.ipynb` notebook:

```python
documents = [
    """
    This whole document is written in English. In order for the whole document to be written
    in English, every sentence also has to be written in English, which it is.
    """,
    "Il documento scritto in italiano.",
    "Dies ist in deutsche Sprache verfasst.",
    "这是一个用中文写的文件",
    "Este es un document escrito en Español.",
    "আমি প্রতি সপ্তাহে বিএমডাব্লিউ-এর বোর্ড অফ ম্যানেজমেন্টের সাথে ফোনে কথা বলি।"
]

response = text_analytics_client.detect_language(documents)
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    print("Language detected: {}".format(doc.primary_language.name))
    print("ISO6391 name: {}".format(doc.primary_language.iso6391_name))
    print("Confidence score: {}\n".format(doc.primary_language.confidence_score))
```

Your result should look like this:

```
Language detected: English
ISO6391 name: en
Confidence score: 1.0

Language detected: Italian
ISO6391 name: it
Confidence score: 0.87

Language detected: German
ISO6391 name: de
Confidence score: 1.0

Language detected: Chinese_Simplified
ISO6391 name: zh_chs
Confidence score: 1.0

Language detected: English
ISO6391 name: en
Confidence score: 1.0

Language detected: Bengali
ISO6391 name: bn
Confidence score: 1.0
```

As you can see, the client can detect a wide range of languages, variants, dialects and some regional languages. If the service cannot detect a language, you will receive the response _unknown_. [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/language-detection/language-support) you can find a list of all supported languages.

### Sentiment Analysis

Secondly, we can analyse the sentiment of a given phrase. Go ahead and copy the code into your `CognitiveServices.ipynb` notebook:

```python
documents = [
    "I did not like the restaurant. The food was somehow both too spicy and underseasoned. Additionally, I thought the location was too far away from the playhouse.",
    "The restaurant was decorated beautifully. The atmosphere was unlike any other restaurant I've been to.",
    "The food was yummy. :)",
    "I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and the staff was helpful.",
    "I had not a great time at the hotel. The staff was rude and the food was awful.",
    "Los caminos que llevan hasta Monte Rainier son espectaculares y hermosos.",
    "La carretera estaba atascada. Había mucho tráfico el día de ayer."
]

response = text_analytics_client.analyze_sentiment(documents, language="en")
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    print("Overall sentiment of sentence {}: {}".format(int(doc.id)+1, doc.sentiment))
    print("Scores: positive={}; neutral={}; negative={} \n".format(
        doc.confidence_scores.positive,
        doc.confidence_scores.neutral,
        doc.confidence_scores.negative,
    ))
```

Your result should look like this:

```
Overall sentiment of sentence 1: negative
Scores: positive=0.01; neutral=0.02; negative=0.98

Overall sentiment of sentence 2: positive
Scores: positive=0.81; neutral=0.03; negative=0.16

Overall sentiment of sentence 3: positive
Scores: positive=0.99; neutral=0.0; negative=0.01

Overall sentiment of sentence 4: positive
Scores: positive=1.0; neutral=0.0; negative=0.0

Overall sentiment of sentence 5: negative
Scores: positive=0.01; neutral=0.0; negative=0.99

Overall sentiment of sentence 6: positive
Scores: positive=0.99; neutral=0.01; negative=0.01

Overall sentiment of sentence 7: negative
Scores: positive=0.07; neutral=0.15; negative=0.78
```

### Key Phrase Extraction

Thirdly, we can extract key phrases from text. In order to do so, copy the following code into your `CognitiveServices.ipynb` notebook:

```python
documents = [
    "Redmond is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located 15 miles east of Seattle.",
    """
    I need to take my cat to the veterinarian. He has been sick recently, and I need to take him
    before I travel to South America for the summer.
    """,
    "I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and the staff was helpful."
]

response = text_analytics_client.extract_key_phrases(documents, language="en")
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    print("Key phrases of sentence {}: {}".format(int(doc.id)+1, ', '.join(doc.key_phrases)))
```

Example Result:

```
Key phrases of sentence 1: King County, United States, Redmond, city, Washington, Seattle
Key phrases of sentence 2: South America, cat, veterinarian, summer
Key phrases of sentence 3: wonderful experience, rooms, staff
```

### Entity Linking

And last but not least, we can detect and link entities in text. Entity linking identifies and disambiguates the identity of entities found in text. For example, in the sentence "We went to Seattle last week.", the word "Seattle" would be identified, with a link to more information on Wikipedia. In order to try it out, copy the code into your `CognitiveServices.ipynb` notebook:

```python
documents = [
    "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Its headquarters are located in Redmond.",
    "Easter Island, a Chilean territory, is a remote volcanic island in Polynesia.",
    "Angela Merkel war bis 2021 die deutsche Bundeskanzlerin und hatte im Deutschen Reichstagsgebäude ihren Sitz."
]

response = text_analytics_client.recognize_linked_entities(documents, language="en")
result = [doc for doc in response if not doc.is_error]

for doc in result:
    for entity in doc.entities:
        print("Entity: {}".format(entity.name))
        print("\tURL: {}".format(entity.url))
        print("\tData Source: {}".format(entity.data_source))
        print("\tEntity matches:")
        for match in entity.matches:
            print("\t\tEntity match text: {}".format(match.text))
            print("\t\tConfidence Score: {}".format(match.confidence_score))
            print("\t\tOffset: {}".format(match.offset))
```

Example result:

```
Entity: Microsoft
	URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft
	Data Source: Wikipedia
	Entity matches:
		Entity match text: Microsoft
		Confidence Score: 0.49
		Offset: 0

	URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesia
	Data Source: Wikipedia
	Entity matches:
		Entity match text: Polynesia
		Confidence Score: 0.25
		Offset: 67
Entity: Angela Merkel
	URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel
	Data Source: Wikipedia
	Entity matches:
		Entity match text: Angela Merkel
		Confidence Score: 0.83
		Offset: 0
Entity: Reichstag building
	URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_building
	Data Source: Wikipedia
	Entity matches:
		Entity match text: Reichstagsgebäude
		Confidence Score: 0.81
		Offset: 79
```

If you want to directly create a dashboard within Power BI from the derived results, have a look at [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/tutorials/tutorial-power-bi-key-phrases).

### Optional: Language Studio

[Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio) is a set of UI-based tools that lets you explore, build, and integrate features from Azure Cognitive Service for Language into your applications. Using the Studio, you can get started without needing to write code, and then use the available client libraries and REST APIs in your application.

Each of the features of the Cognitive Service for Language has a demo-like experience inside Language Studio that lets you input text, and presents the response both visually, and in JSON. These demos help you quickly test these prebuilt features without using code.

Since we looked at _Entity Linking_ in the last paragraph, let's check out the Studio's capabilities for this feature.

1. Go to the [Language Studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio)
2. Log in using your Azure account.
3. A window will pop up prompting you to choose a language resource. Choose the one you created previously.
4. Choose the feature _Find linked entities_.
5. Paste the same text as before (Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800.) into the box and hit _Run_.
6. Examine the results.

Feel free to try out the Language Studio for some of the other features.


### Optional: Postman

We can repeat the previous steps to do the same for the Text Analytics API in Postman.

[Here](./postman/) you will find the Postman collections we have created for you for the Translation and Text Analytics API. 

- Download the Text Analytics file and  _Import_ it to your Postman. After the import is done it should look like this. 
- Create an  _Environment_ for the Text Analytics API.
- Add only the api_key variable. Set it as "secret" and paste the key for that service as found in the portal.

![Postman environments](./images/02_postman_create_environments.png)

- Finally, assign the environment created to the respective collection. 

![Postman environment assign](./images/02_environment_select.png).

Try the different APIs!

![Postman response](./images/02_postman_result.png)

So far, we have covered the Language pillar of the Cognitive Services such as Translation. In a next step, we will look at the pillar _Speech_.

In this section, you will learn about the benefits and capabilities of the **Text-to-speech Cognitive Service**, which enables your applications, tools, or devices to convert text into human-like synthesized speech and the **Speech-to-text Cognitive Service** which enables your application, tools, or devices to convert real-time transcription of audio streams into text. These are two among many more capabilities of the Speech service.

In the language of your choice write two small scripts or apps that:

1. Convert written text into speech (German or English)
1. Convert speech into written text (German or English)

This time, we will use the Python SDK for using the service.

First, we need to deploy a Speech service:

![alt text](./images/speech_api_service.png "Speech API Service")

Fill in a _unique name_ and select _create_:

![Azure Portal](./images/CreateSpeech.png)

You can find your API key under the service, then `Keys`.

## Text-to-Speech

To use any SDK, you need to first install it. In this case we will install the Python Speech SDK. Paste the following code in your jupyter notebook:

```python
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech
```

If you are using a **Mac**, you might need to run this first:

```python
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Once the SDK is installed, please restart the kernel. After that we can write our code. Firstly, create a speech configuration instance and import the necessary libraries. Next, define the [language and voice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support#prebuilt-neural-voices). We have already selected them for your. Feel free to change them up a little. Then creates an `AudioOutputConfig` instance, which writes the audio output to a .wav file. Furthermore, execute the speech synthesis and writing to the .wav file. Lastly, display the audio output.

```python
import azure.cognitiveservices.speech as speechsdk # import the speech sdk
import IPython.display as ipd # import IPython.display to display the audio output

speech_config = speechsdk.SpeechConfig(subscription="YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY", region="YOUR_RESOURCE_LOCATION")

def to_file():
  speech_config.speech_synthesis_language = "en-US"
  speech_config.speech_synthesis_voice_name ="en-GB-SoniaNeural"
  audio_config = speechsdk.audio.AudioOutputConfig(filename="welcome.wav")
  synthesizer = speechsdk.SpeechSynthesizer(speech_config=speech_config, audio_config=audio_config)
  synthesizer.speak_text_async("Hello, welcome to the AI Developer College!")

to_file()

ipd.Audio('welcome.wav')
```

As mentioned earlier, there are [many different voices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support#text-to-speech) available to choose from. By updating `speech_config.speech_synthesis_voice_name` and `speech_config.speech_synthesis_voice_name` we can easily specify a different language or voice. From here on, it should be easy to generate German speech. Try it out!

## Speech-to-Text

Let's take the generated or provided `welcome.wav` from the example before and convert it back to text.

Paste the following code in the notebook you used before.

```python
def from_file():
  speech_config.speech_synthesis_language = "en-US"
  speech_config.speech_synthesis_voice_name ="en-GB-SoniaNeural"
  audio_input = speechsdk.AudioConfig(filename="welcome.wav")
  speech_recognizer = speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer(speech_config=speech_config, audio_config=audio_input)
  result = speech_recognizer.recognize_once_async().get()
  print(result.text)

from_file()
```

For recognizing longer text with multiple sentences, you can follow the [following tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/quickstart-python).

**_Note:_**

Compressed audio is also supported (e.g., MP3s), see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams),

Besides that, the speech-to-text API expects audio with the following specifics:

- 16-bit WAV format with PCM or OGG format with OPUS
- Single channel (mono) at 8 or 16 KHz

More details, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-use-audio-input-streams).

## Optional: Speech Studio

[Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal) is a set of UI-based tools for building and integrating features from Azure Cognitive Services Speech service in your applications. You create projects in Speech Studio by using a no-code approach, and then reference those assets in your applications by using the Speech SDK, the Speech CLI, or the REST APIs. This is especially useful if you want to run quick tests.

Try performing text-to-speech and speech-to-text with the Speech Studio.

1. Go to the [Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal)
2. Click on **Real-time Speech-to-text**

- Try out the different features

3. Click on **Audio Content Creation**

- Create a new text file or upload one
- Try out different voices
- Export the audio file

So far we have focused on the two pillars _Language_ and _Speech_. Now we want to jump to the pillar _Vision_ by analysing images.

# Vision

Since more and more apps recognize faces, there is also a **Face Cognitive Service** for that. The Azure Face service provides AI algorithms that detect, recognize, and analyze human faces in images. Facial recognition software is important in many different scenarios, such as security, natural user interface, image content analysis and management, mobile apps, and robotics.

## Face

| Azure Cognitive Services                                                    | Information                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Face API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/) | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/ |

:triangular_flag_on_post: **Goal:** Detect, identify, and analyze faces in images.

This time we will conduct a REST Call and send an image of a face to the Face Cognitive Service and get a JSON response in return which explains the found characteristics of a face e.g. `faceAttributes`.

1. Deploy a Face API Service in the Portal

![Deploy Face API](./images/New_CreateFace.PNG)

![Details of Deploy Face API](./images/deployfacedetails.png)

To use **Face API**, perform the following steps:

2. Copy code below into a new cell into the `CognitiveServices.ipynb` Notebook.
3. Make the following changes in code where needed:
   1. Replace the value of `api_key` with your api key.
   2. Edit the value of `face_api_url` to include the endpoint URL for your Face API resource.
   3. Optionally, replace the value of `image_url` with the URL of a different image that you want to analyze.
4. Run the Cell and examine the response.

```python
import requests
import json

# set to your own api key value
subscription_key = "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"
endpoint = "YOUR_RESOURCE_ENDPOINT"

face_api_url = endpoint + 'face/v1.0/detect'

image_url = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Dagestani_man_and_woman.jpg'

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}

params = {
    'returnFaceId': 'true',
    'returnFaceLandmarks': 'false',
    'returnFaceAttributes': 'age,gender,headPose,smile,facialHair,glasses,emotion,hair,makeup,occlusion,accessories,blur,exposure,noise',
}

response = requests.post(face_api_url, params=params,
                         headers=headers, json={"url": image_url})
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent = 2))
```

### Examine the response

A successful response is returned in JSON (snippet):

```json
[
  {
    "faceId": "e93e0db1-036e-4819-b5b6-4f39e0f73509",
    "faceRectangle": {
      "top": 621,
      "left": 616,
      "width": 195,
      "height": 195
    },
    "faceAttributes": {
      "smile": 0,
      "headPose": {
        "pitch": 0,
        "roll": 6.8,
        "yaw": 3.7
      },
      "gender": "male",
      "age": 37,
      "facialHair": {
        "moustache": 0.4,
        "beard": 0.4,
        "sideburns": 0.1
      },
      "glasses": "NoGlasses",
      "emotion": {
        "anger": 0,
        "contempt": 0,
        "disgust": 0,
        "fear": 0,
        "happiness": 0,
        "neutral": 0.999,
        "sadness": 0.001,
        "surprise": 0
      }
```

As you can see in the image yourself and from the JSON-response, the image shows a male 37-year old with a moustache. He is not wearing glasses and shows a neutral emotion. The image also shows a 56-year old female person without glasses.

As we have already started to investigate images, we will now look at a different service the **Computer Vision Cognitive Service** to analyze text on an image.

Azure's Computer Vision API includes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities that extract printed or handwritten text from images. You can extract text from images, such as photos of license plates or containers with serial numbers, as well as from documents - invoices, bills, financial reports, articles, and more.

## Computer Vision

| Azure Cognitive Services                                                                             | Information                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision) | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/home |

In the language of your choice (Python solution is provided), write two small scripts that

1. Convert hand-written text from an image into text - Test data: [1](https://bootcamps.blob.core.windows.net/ml-test-images/ocr_handwritten_1.jpg), [2](https://bootcamps.blob.core.windows.net/ml-test-images/ocr_handwritten_2.jpg)
1. Convert printed text from an image into text - Test data: [1](https://bootcamps.blob.core.windows.net/ml-test-images/ocr_printed_1.jpg), [2](https://bootcamps.blob.core.windows.net/ml-test-images/ocr_printed_2.jpg)

Once again we will conduct REST Calls to the Computer Vision Cognitive Service and get a JSON in response.

The Computer Vision API offers several services for processing images:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Image Analysis
- Spatial Analysis

In this section, we will concentrate on the service's OCR capabilities. It can extract information from printed text (in several languages), handwritten text (English only + Chinese, French, German and Italian in preview), digits, and currency symbols from images and multi-page PDF documents. It's optimized to extract text from text-heavy images and multi-page PDF documents with mixed languages. It supports detecting both printed and handwritten text in the same image or document. You can get more details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-recognizing-text#:~:text=%20Optical%20Character%20Recognition%20%28OCR%29%20%201%20Read,PDF%20document%20as%20the%20input%20and...%20More%20).

### Optical Character Recognition - Images to Text - Handwritten content

:triangular_flag_on_post: **Goal:** Leverage OCR to make a hand-written text document in images machine-readable

First, create a `Computer Vision` API Key in the Azure Portal

![Create Computer Vision](./images/ComputerVisionCreate.png)

![Create Computer Vision Details](./images/ComputerVisionCreateDetails.png)

As we're dealing with images, we need a few Python packages to help with this. Go ahead and copy the code into a new Cell in your `CognitiveServices.ipynb` Notebook.

```python
import requests, json, time
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle
from matplotlib.patches import Polygon
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
```

Ok, now we can start recognizing some text. With the Computer Vision API, this is a two-step process:

1. Submit the image (Post-request)
1. Query if the image has been processed (Get-request)

```python
subscription_key = "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"
location = "YOUR_RESOURCE_REGION"

url = "https://" + location + ".api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v3.2/read/analyze"
image_url = "https://bootcamps.blob.core.windows.net/ml-test-images/ocr_handwritten_1.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key, 'Content-type': 'application/json'}
data    = {'url': image_url}

# Post image URL to the API
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

# Return query URL for getting the status
operation_url = response.headers["Operation-Location"]

# Poll until we get a result (...or something failed)
recognition = {}
poll = True
while (poll):
    response_final = requests.get(operation_url, headers=headers)
    recognition = response_final.json()
    time.sleep(1)
    if ("analyzeResult" in recognition):
        poll = False
    if ("status" in recognition and recognition['status'] == 'failed'):
        poll = False

print(json.dumps(recognition, indent=2))
```

The result should look like this (just a snippet):

```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "createdDateTime": "2022-02-22T10:47:47Z",
  "lastUpdatedDateTime": "2022-02-22T10:47:48Z",
  "analyzeResult": {
    "version": "3.2.0",
    "modelVersion": "2021-04-12",
    "readResults": [

        "angle": 4.7589,
        "width": 1000,
        "height": 978,
        "unit": "pixel",
        "lines": [
          {
            "boundingBox": [
              272,
              260,
              858,
              286,
              856,
              389,
              266,
              366
            ],
            "text": "Shopping list :",
            "appearance": {
              "style": {
                "name": "handwriting",
                "confidence": 0.785
              }
            },
            "words": [
              {
                "boundingBox": [
                  279,
                  260,
                  653,
                  284,
                  649,
                  389,
                  267,
                  348
                ],
                "text": "Shopping",
                "confidence": 0.994
              },
              {
                "boundingBox": [
                  676,
                  285,
                  803,
                  286,
                  803,
                  388,
                  673,
                  389
                ],
                "text": "list",
                "confidence": 0.92
              }
```

Ok, looks like it recognized something. Let's visualize it:

```python
polygons = []

# Get bounding boxes of the text
if ("analyzeResult" in recognition):
    analyzeResult = recognition["analyzeResult"]
    readResults = analyzeResult["readResults"]
   # print(json.dumps(r, indent=2))
    for line in readResults[0]["lines"]:
        polygons += [(line["boundingBox"], line["text"])]

# Display image and overlay text
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
ax = plt.imshow(image)
for polygon in polygons:
    vertices = [(polygon[0][i], polygon[0][i+1])
        for i in range(0, len(polygon[0]), 2)]
    text = polygon[1]
    patch = Polygon(vertices, closed=True, fill=False, linewidth=2, color='y')
    ax.axes.add_patch(patch)
    plt.text(vertices[0][0], vertices[0][1], text, fontsize=20, va="top")
_ = plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

**Visualization:**

![Result](./images/ComputerVisionBoxes.png)

**Here is another image we can test with:**

> [Calender Motto Test Image](https://bootcamps.blob.core.windows.net/ml-test-images/ocr_handwritten_2.jpg)

In a next step, we will use the same service by just extracting text from printed text in images.

### Optical Character Recognition - Images to Text - Printed content

:triangular_flag_on_post: **Goal:** Leverage OCR to make a printed text document in images machine-readable

It is very similar as the previous example- except that is a synchronous call, hence we directly get back the recognition result. Go ahead and copy the Code into a new Cell into your `CognitiveServices.ipynb` Notebook:

```python
url = "https://" + location + ".api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v3.2/ocr"
image_url = "https://bootcamps.blob.core.windows.net/ml-test-images/ocr_printed_1.jpg"

headers = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key}
params  = {'language': 'unk', 'detectOrientation': 'true'}
data    = {'url': image_url}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, params=params, json=data)
recognition_result = response.json()

# Extract the word bounding boxes and text
line_infos = [region["lines"] for region in recognition_result["regions"]]
word_infos = []
for line in line_infos:
    for word_metadata in line:
        for word_info in word_metadata["words"]:
            word_infos.append(word_info)
word_infos
```

**Example JSON response (just a snippet):**

```json
[
  { "boundingBox": "31,50,817,70", "text": "LUFTPOLSTERTASCHEN" },
  { "boundingBox": "30,219,23,24", "text": "u" },
  { "boundingBox": "68,216,168,27", "text": "Fensterlose" },
  { "boundingBox": "247,216,263,37", "text": "Schutzumschläge" },
  { "boundingBox": "522,221,47,26", "text": "mit" },
  { "boundingBox": "580,221,182,37", "text": "Haftklebung" },
  { "boundingBox": "66,276,149,34", "text": "Optimaler" },
  { "boundingBox": "225,276,99,27", "text": "Schutz" },
  { "boundingBox": "334,277,84,26", "text": "durch" },
  { "boundingBox": "432,277,227,35", "text": "Luftpolsterfolie" }
]
```

**Visualization:**

```python
# Display the image and overlay it with the extracted text
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))
image = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(image_url).content))
ax = plt.imshow(image, alpha=0.5)
for word in word_infos:
    bbox = [int(num) for num in word["boundingBox"].split(",")]
    text = word["text"]
    origin = (bbox[0], bbox[1])
    patch  = Rectangle(origin, bbox[2], bbox[3], fill=False, linewidth=2, color='y')
    ax.axes.add_patch(patch)
    plt.text(origin[0], origin[1], text, fontsize=11, va="top")
_ = plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

**Example Result:**

![Result](./images/OCRResult.png)

**Here is one more [image](https://bootcamps.blob.core.windows.net/ml-test-images/ocr_printed_2.jpg) we can test with!**

From recognizing text on images we will now detect objects on images for this we will introduce the **Custom Vision Cognitive Service.**

**Azure Custom Vision** is an image recognition service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image identifiers. An image identifier applies labels (which represent classes or objects) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels and train custom models to detect them.

## Custom Vision

| Azure Cognitive Services                                                                              | Information                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Custom Vision API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/ |

:triangular_flag_on_post: **Goal:** Detect beer glasses in images

**What it does?**
The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze images. You, the developer, submits groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then, the algorithm trains with this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it in your image recognition app to classify new images. You can also export the model itself for offline use.

In this chapter, we will use [Custom Vision](https://customvision.ai) to build a flower image classifier.

First we deploy the **Azure Custom Vision** Service in the **Azure Portal**:

![Azure Portal](./images/CustomVision1.png)

The Custom Vision Service has 2 types of endpoints. One for training the model and one for running predictions against the model. For this example, we will use both. Therfore, select _both_. Fill in the _name_ and the _region_ as well as the _pricing tier (F0)_ for the training and the prediction resource. Then hit _create_.

![Azure Portal](./images/CustomVision2.png)

Then, log in to [Custom Vision](https://www.customvision.ai/) with your Azure credentials.

Create a new project of type `Classification`, classification type `Multiclass` and Domain `General`:

![alt text](./images/CustomVision4.png "Custom Vision Project")

Next, create tags for the different flower types our image classifier will be able to detect - daisy, rose, tulip, water lily and negative (none of the 4 flower types). Then upload minimum 15 **training images** per tag and tag them accordingly. Feel free to develop an image classifier with different images than flowers if this is what you prefer.

![alt text](./images/CustomVision6.png "Tagging the training images")

Once we've tagged all images, we can hit the `Train` button. For this challenge choose _Quick Training_. After 1-2 minutes, we'll see the training statistics:

![alt text](./images/customvision_performance.png "Image classification performance")

Let's briefly look at the results and make sure we understand them:

- **Precision** indicates the fraction of identified classifications that were correct. For example, if the classifier detects 10 images as tulips and only 5 images are actual tulips, the precision would be 50%.
- **Recall** indicates the fraction of actual classifications that were correctly identified. For example, if the classifier detects 10 images as roses and 10 are actual roses, the recall would be 50%.
- ** - Average Precision** summarises the precision and recall at different thresholds.

Under `Quick Test`, we can briefly test images and see what the service will detect. Look for the different flower types online and paste the image URLs in the Quick Test section. We only added a few training images (50 per tag are recommended) with a lot of variance, the results are not great yet. By adding more images, we could most likely improve the performance significantly.

If we go to the `Performance` tab, we can get the `Prediction URL` and the `Prediction-Key`. We can use this endpoint to programmatically access the service. We will do this in a later challenge.

## What we have done so far:

- We deployed several Cognitive Services using the Azure Portal
- We called those Cognitive Service REST APIs by using Python
- We trained custom machine learning models (e.g. Custom Vision) using an UI

In a next step, we want to see how the cognitive services can be embedded into an application.
